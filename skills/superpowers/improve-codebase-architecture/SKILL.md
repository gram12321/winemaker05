# Improve Codebase Architecture

Use only for an explicit architecture/refactor review; it is not a routine completion gate.

Read the relevant modules, `PROJECT_INFO.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `design.md` before proposing changes. Identify concrete friction with file references: mixed rule/render/UI ownership, duplicated coordinate conversion, stale derived state, scene lifetime leaks, asset lifecycle confusion, or a needless abstraction.

Present focused candidates with the problem, smallest affected files, intended owner, benefit, risk, and focused verification. If the user requested implementation, proceed within that scope; a review-only request should report recommendations without changing code.

For detailed evaluation criteria, read [references/architecture-boundaries.md](references/architecture-boundaries.md).
